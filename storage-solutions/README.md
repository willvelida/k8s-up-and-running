# Integrating Storage Solutions and Kubernetes

## Importing External Services

- In many cases, you have an existing machine running in your network that has some sort of database running on it.
- In this case, you may not want to immediately move that database into containers and Kubernetes.
- Perhaps it is run by a different team, or you are doing a gradual move, or the task of migrating the data is simply more trouble than it's worth.
